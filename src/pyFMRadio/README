pyFMRadio
=========

pyFMRadio is a pure Python module for controlling the built-in FM radio on the
Nokia N800 internet tablet. It doesn't have any dependencies except the Python
standard modules.

See example.py for a simple example.
  
Have fun and use pyFMRadio to create great radio applications for the N800! :)
